## Step 0: Things you need

([Telegram Group](https://telegram.org/tour/groups)) Preferably a group with message history ([supergroup](https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups)) so new members can see whats going on? but it will work with normal group

## Step 1: Go to the website

([Website](https://formsg-gsheet.herokuapp.com/))

## Step 4: Add Telegram Group ID

You will need to get the ([Telegram Group ID](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46247058)) by adding ([@RawDataBot](https://t.me/raw_data_bot)). Don't forget to kick the bot out once you retrieve the Group ID

You will also need to add the bot: ([@FormSG_Telegram_Notify_bot](https://t.me/FormSG_Telegram_Notify_bot)) into the group
